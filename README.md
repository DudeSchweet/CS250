# CS250 Module 8 Journal

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program?
  * I break down the behavior and features into manageable pieces and consider the design.  If the behavior or feature fits a particular programming pattern, then I apply that.  Otherwise, it is a matter of finding the most straightforward solution to the requirements.
* How does creating "user stories" help with this?
  * The user story gives an overview.  I interpret it as "what" the customer, product owner, etc., wants or needs.  I determine "how" I will implement this requirement by breaking it down as mentioned above.
* How do I approach developing programs?
  * I like to consider the overall ask and first determine if there are solutions out there currently.  Why unnecessarily reinvent the wheel?  Most likely, there is a framework that I can build my code with some simple refactorings to bit the ask.
* What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  * I currently utilize scrum-agile, and I work on a team where I am the lead developer.  I also assist the PO with all aspects of the scrum cycle.
* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  * A good developer will continuously learn and be sure to listen.  Always look to add new tools to your developer toolbox.
